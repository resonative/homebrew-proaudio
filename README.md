# Homebrew ProAudio

Some cask formulae of pro audio software. This tap mainly streamline/assist setting up new system (vs maintaining legacy system.) Companies' dedicated installer/portal (NI, Izotope, etc) is preferred.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install resonative/proaudio/<formula>`

Or `brew tap resonative/proaudio` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "resonative/proaudio"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
